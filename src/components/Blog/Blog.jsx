            Q: What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and

          </h3>
          <p>
            An access token and refresh token are commonly used in
            authentication and authorization systems.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Access Token:</span> An access token is a credential that is
            used to authenticate and authorize a client to access protected
            resources on a server. It is typically a string of characters
            generated by the server and issued to the client after successful
            authentication. The access token should be stored on the
            client-side, usually in memory or a browser storage mechanism like
            localStorage or sessionStorage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Refresh Token:</span> A refresh token is a long-lived
            credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the
            current one expires. It is securely stored by the client and sent to
            the server when needed to obtain a new access token. The refresh
            token should be stored securely on the client-side, typically in an
            HTTP-only cookie.

          <p>
            <span>Schema:</span> NoSQL databases are schema-less, allowing

          <h3>Q: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work</h3>
          <p>
            In MongoDB, the aggregate operation is a powerful method for
            processing and analyzing data within a collection. It allows us to
            perform advanced data manipulations, transformations, and
            aggregations on the documents in the collection. Here's a high-level
            overview of how the MongoDB aggregate operation works:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Data Processing:</span> The documents in the collection are
            processed through the pipeline stages sequentially. Each stage takes
            the input from the previous stage and performs its operation,
            generating intermediate results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Document Transformation:</span> Each stage can transform the
            documents in various ways, such as filtering, projecting specific
            fields, grouping, sorting, or performing mathematical calculations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Aggregation Functions:</span> MongoDB provides a set of
            aggregation functions that can be used within the stages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Final Result:</span> After all the stages have been
            processed, the output is returned as the result of the aggregate
            operation. The result can be a single document, a set of documents,
            or even a computed value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MongoDB aggregate operation is particularly useful when we need
            to perform complex data analysis, generate reports, compute
            statistics, or combine data from multiple collections.
